It\\\'s what you and many other people will drive to work in, ten years and more from now. At that time, before you drive off in the morning you will first unplug your car - your plug-in vehicle. Its big onboard batteries will have been fully charged overnight, with enough power for you to drive 50-100 kilometres through city traffic. When you arrive at work you\\\'ll plug in your car once again, this time into a socket that allows power to flow from your car\\\'s batteries to the electricity grid. One of the things you did when you bought your car was to sign a contract with your favourite electricity supplier, allowing them to draw a limited amount of power from your car\\\'s batteries should they need to, perhaps because of a blackout, or very high wholesale spot power prices. The price you get for the power the distributor buys form your car would not only be most attractive to you, but it would also be a good deal for them too, their alternative being very expensive power form peaking stations. If driving home or for some other reason your batteries looked like running flat, a relatively small, but quiet and efficient engine running on petrol, diesel or compressed natural gas, even bio-fuel, would automatically cut in, driving a generator that supplied the batteries so you could complete your journey. Concerns over \\\'peak oil\\\', increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and the likelihood that by the middle of this century there could be five times as many motor vehicles registered worldwide as there are now, mean that the world\\\'s almost total dependence on petroleum-based fuels for transport is, in every sense of the word, unsustainable.', 'PEV(Plug-in-vehicle) will be a remarkable invention in future that will use electricity to charge itself, alternatively, it could also be used by electricity distributors at peaking stations as an electricity source, thus making it mutually benefitting and eco-friendly eradicating problems like climate change and total dependence on petroleum-based products.', '', NULL, '2021-01-05'),

Since identical twins share the same genes while fraternal twins share about half their genes, the researchers were able to compare each group to show that myelin integrity was determined genetically in many parts of the brain that are key for intelligence. These include the parietal lobes, which are responsible for spatial reasoning, visual processing and logic, and the corpus callosum, which pulls together information from both sides of the body. The researchers used a faster version of a type of scanner called a HARDI (high-angular resolution diffusion imaging) — think of an MRI machine on steroids — that takes scans of the brain at a much higher resolution than a standard MRI. While an MRI scan shows the volume of different tissues in the brain by measuring the amount of water present, HARDI tracks how water diffuses through the brain\\\'s white matter — a way to measure the quality of its myelin. \\\"HARDI measures water diffusion,\\\" said Thompson, who is also a member of the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro-Imaging. \\\"If the water diffuses rapidly in a specific direction, it tells us that the brain has very fast connections. If it diffuses more broadly, that\\\'s an indication of slower signalling and lower intelligence.\\\"', 'Since identical twins share the same genes while fraternal twins share about half their genes, the researchers were able to compare each group using HARDI scanner to find out if the brain has a fast connection or low intelligence.', '', NULL, '2021-01-05'),

But a new study of 59 North American bird species indicates that doing so is not easy or quick -- it took about 35 years for many birds to move far enough north for winter temperatures to match where they historically lived. For example, black vultures have spread northward in the last 35 years and now winter as far north as Massachusetts, where the minimum winter temperature is similar to what it was in Maryland in 1975. On the other hand, the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker did not alter its range at all despite the warming trend, possibly because it\\\'s very specific habitat requirements precluded a range shift. Both of these scenarios could represent problems for birds, La Sorte said. Species that do not track changes in climate may wind up at the limits of their physiological tolerance, or they may lose important habitat qualities, such as favored food types, as those species pass them by. But they also can\\\'t move their ranges too fast if the habitat conditions they depend on also tend to lag behind climate.', 'A new study on different bird species reveals that they migrated northwards to shift their ranges in temperature and this shift hasn’t been so quick, it took them about 35 years to move north towards winter temperatures because some bird species do not track climate change at all and adjust themselves in present habitat conditions.', '', NULL, '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

They found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic makeup indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought.', '', 'There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought.', '', '', '', '', '2021-01-05'),

This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.', 'A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.', 'There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.', 'An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere.
